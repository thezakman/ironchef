= Introduction =

Written by David Morgan-Mar, Chef is widely regarded as the most esoteric of programming languages. Designed with a consistent theme, it implements most of the essential actions of a programming language (and is Turing-complete). (The only thing it appears to be missing is support for file i/o, but such is not required for Turing-completeness.)
